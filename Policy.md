In general, while leaving a comment on any post, go through the following checklist:-
  * Is this comment relavent to the topic in discussion?
  * In case it's criticism, is it constructive or just hateful?
  * Is it insulting to any other person commenting on the thread, or just any other person in general?
  * Does the comment use expletives unnecessarily?

In case the comment is able to not fail on any of these questions, then its probably okay to post it on this site.
